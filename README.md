# Coin-Op

1. Run update_all script with alternatives option activated for both regular and JT repository.

It will complete /_Arcade/alternatives with missing mra files and Folder (_Tetris and _Atari Tetris mixed up in _Tetris if leaved as is)
it will then create a sorted _Coin-Op folder in /_Arcade at root of SD card.
